# About Pensieve

Pensieves are items from the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. They are used to deposit memories and then analyze them from an external point of view.

In a similar way, this repository will store my ideas, memories, acquired information, among others. At the moment I am using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for this. For more details you can read the contents of [[README | my workshop]].

I hope to turn this into a page someday. Wish me luck!
